        Iâ€™m <strong>Diya Dahal</strong> â€” Turning imagination into real.<br />
        A little quiet at first, but full of energy once you know me.<br />
        I enjoy creating, organizing, and finding new ways to make life<br />
        a little more inspiring every day.
      </p>

      <h3>Let me talk about myself</h3>

      <p>
        In the quiet moments, I find joy in content creation, and organizing
        life in creative ways.<br />
        I'm an <em>ambivert</em>: a little reserved at first, but once I
        connect, I bring a lot of energy, creativity, and passion into
        everything I do.<br />
        I love creating and planningâ€”these little rituals keep me inspired.
      </p>

      <p>
        Iâ€™m deeply drawn to growth, creativity, and exploration. I love learning
        new skills, diving into ideas that challenge me, and finding beauty in
        meaningful conversations.<br />
        I'm passionate about building thoughtful projects that bring purpose to
        everyday life and discovering new ways to live intentionallyâ€”with
        creativity and heart at the center of it all.
