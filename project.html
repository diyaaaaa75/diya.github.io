        As a computer engineering student, Iâ€™m learning web development step by
        step and creating projects that reflect my growth.<br />
        From designing portfolio websites with HTML & CSS to experimenting with
        React by building a personal planner app,each<br />
        project shows how Iâ€™m combining creativity with technology. Iâ€™m still
        learning with the flow â€” exploring new tools, <br />improving my coding
        skills, and planning to learn Java to strengthen both my web development
        and programming foundation.

              <h4>Contact Management System</h4>
              <p>
                This was my first project during the 3rd semester, built using
                C++ in Dev C++. The system allows users to add, search,<br />
                update, and delete contacts, storing the information efficiently
                using file handling. Through this project, I learned
                essential<br />
                programming concepts such as data structures, CRUD operations,
                and logical problem-solving. It was my first real experience<br />
                turning code into a functional application and gave me the
                confidence to take on more complex projects in web development
                and beyond.

              <h4>AI Image Generation</h4>
              <p>
                This 5th-semester project is a web application that allows users
                to create images from text prompts using AI. Built with
                MongoDB,<br />
                Express.js, React, and Node.js, it features a user-friendly
                interface where generated images can be viewed, saved, or
                downloaded.<br />
                The project helped me gain practical experience in full-stack
                development, API integration, database handling, and connecting
                a<br />
                web app with AI services, giving me valuable insights into
                modern web development workflows.

              <p>
                This project is a food-themed web application that I built using
                HTML, CSS. It
                allows<br />
                users to browse dishes, view menus, and interact with the
                interface in a playful and engaging way. Displaying a menu of
                dishes with<br />
                images and descriptions. Interactive elements like buttons,
                hover effects, and dynamic content.
